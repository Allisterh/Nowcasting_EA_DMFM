# Nowcasting_DMFM
The most recent macroeconometric literature has proposed Dynamic Matrix Factor Models (\textit{DMFMs}) to address two major challenges in empirical analysis. First, this specification manages the high dimensionality of modern datasets through the use of low-rank latent structures; second, it improves model accuracy and forecasting performance by incorporating the dynamics of latent variables. The key innovation introduced by these models, compared to their vector counterparts, is the preservation of the natural matrix structure inherent in macroeconomic data.\\
This thesis presents a novel application of \textit{DMFMs} for nowcasting matrix-variate time series, specifically focusing on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of major Euro Area (EA) countries. Nowcasts are produced by recursively estimating the DMFM parameters using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, by simulating a pseudo real-time forecasting exercise.\\
This empirical framework allows for handling (i) the matrix structure of the data, (ii) mixed-frequency datastes, and (iii) general patterns of missing data, such as those introduced by the COVID-19 disruptions.\\
Standard Dynamic Factor Models (\textit{DFMs}) in vector form are used as a benchmark to evaluate the nowcasting performance of \textit{DMFMs}. Empirical results show that, under certain conditions, the additional dimensionality captured by \textit{DMFMs} enhances forecasting accuracy. In particular, nowcasts for Germany and Italy significantly improve, suggesting that more interconnected and structurally central countries benefit the most from the matrix-based formulation.\\
